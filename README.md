Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for a given dataset using Python.
This project analyzes the dataset, evaluates various ML models (like decision trees, SVM, and k-NN), and selects the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for optimal results.
I hope you like this Project.Thank You.
